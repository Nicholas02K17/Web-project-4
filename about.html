            <section id="section1">
                <p>Escape the bunker is a game inspired by a Roblox game called area 51 created by homermafia1.</p>
                <br />
                <p>But unlike the Roblox version, this one has been created in an application called unity, 
                    which is a powerful and popular game engine used by millions of developers worldwide to create fun games.</p>
                <br />
                <p>But the process wasn&apos;t just unity, 
                    I had multiple scripts for this game to make sure that everything functions properly </p>
                <br />
                <p>If you want to see the scripts, they are in the zipped folder with the project itself, so if you ever had the idea to install
                    cheats from a random pirate website, you don&apos;t have to! Because the scripts are already included in the downloadable file!
                    But not just the scripts! The objects, colors, all of that is included in the downloadable zip folder, which means that you can
                    just make the cheats yourself! It's like buying a tractor and wanting to 
                    buy some additional parts, but the parts are already included in the package with the tractor!</p>
                <br />

                <p>You may wonder why I said “I”, well, I did create this myself, 
                    then you may ask, “well why don&apos;t you have a team?” I don&apos;t
                    have a team because this was simply a school project, and Guess what? This is a school project as well, 
                    yes, you read that right, making a website for you to install this fun game was the most convenient thing I could have 
                    done for a school project, so you don&apos;t have to go on pirated websites to install this game.</p>
                <br />
                <p>If you try to pirate this game, you will face big consequences, and the pirate website will face them as well, 
                    there is no reason to pirate the game as well because the game is FREE! </p>
                <br />
                <p>A lot of hard work was put into this game, including an entire log i had to write to record what I did each day.
                    If you want to see the log on what the development looked like each day, the downloadable file is here! </p>
